## Compilation
Use Visual Studio to compile the Account Manager and Unity Editor version `2022.3.21f1` to compile the game. If you are unable to compile it yourself, you can download pre-compiled versions of the game and Account Manager from [Dragonboy-CommunityMod-Builds](https://github.com/ElectroHeavenVN/Dragonboy-CommunityMod-Builds) hosted by [@ElectroHeavenVN](https://github.com/ElectroHeavenVN).
